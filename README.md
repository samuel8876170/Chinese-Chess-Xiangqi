# Chinese-Chess-Xiangqi

It is a chinese chess game which is similar with the typical chess most people played.
  -This code is simple and not perfectly optimized / even some missing rules 
      (If you have any more efficient way/ideas, tell me! I really want to know)
  -no any online functions (local game)
  -no ai to play with you (human vs human only)

If you don't know which pieces refer to which class, you can find the img file recognise the name and its appearance.

If you don't know about this game, I try to explain it a little:
  The Goal is to checkmate the opponent's king then win.
  Different type of piece have different move route of course. 
    (If you want to know the details of it, just try to download the files and play a few moves with each pieces.)
  I believe the most complicated route of piece is the 'Cannon'(class name of .py is 'Boom' lol) which 
    need a intermediary(teammates/opponents' pieces) to capture the opponents.
