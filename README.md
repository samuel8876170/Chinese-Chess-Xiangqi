# Chinese-Chess-Xiangqi

It is a chinese chess game which is similar with the typical chess most people played.<br/>
    -This code is simple and not perfectly optimized / even some missing rules <br/>
        (If you have any more efficient way/ideas, tell me! I really want to know)<br/>
    -no any online functions (local game)<br/>
    -no ai to play with you (human vs human only)<br/>

If you don't know which pieces refer to which class, you can find the img file recognise the name and its appearance.<br/>

If you don't know about this game, I try to explain it a little: <br/>
    The Goal is to checkmate the opponent's king then win.<br/>
    Different type of piece have different move route of course. <br/>
        (If you want to know the details of it, just try to download the files and play a few moves with each pieces.)<br/>
    I believe the most complicated route of piece is the 'Cannon'(class name of .py is 'Boom' lol) which <br/>
        need a intermediary(teammates/opponents' pieces) to capture the opponents.<br/>
